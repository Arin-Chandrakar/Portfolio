# Reality

Today is 28th December. You are stagnant af right now. If you continue like this. You will probably end up doing nothing and accounting for nothing. Now is the time to flip. To sacrifice everything and start to get the job done. Don’t be mediocre. Be great. Be a person who grinds.

Create. Build.  Grind. Sacrifice. 

You can either sharpen yourself like a knife. Or you will end up with nothing. 

Be the change you want to see in the world. Make the change you need.

Everyday before bed. Make the schedule for the next day. 

Work for that. 

Maintain a healthy lifestyle. Keep yourself sane. Don’t let the society fool you. Hit the wall harder than it hits you. Break that wall. You need to fail in order to succeed. 

Be the guy you always wanted to be Arin.

Build in public. Cry. Break. Get up again. Don’t let yourself slip away.

That kid knows the real you. What you are capable of. Get it done. Out do it.

Now get back to work.
